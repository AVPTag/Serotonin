Serotonin is a semi-tethered/semi-untethered jailbreak for iOS 17-18.7.2 targetting A4-A18 utilizing the Safari WebKit Leftover Bugs.

|| NOTE: Serotonin is no longer based off of Dopamine. This jailbreak is also not related to other jailbreaks named Serotonin. ||

Serotonin is a semi tethered / semi untethered jailbreak for iOS and iPadOS (soon to cover more) 17-18.7.2. The jailbreak will target all devices running A4-A11, A12-A18, and M1-M2.

How does it work?

Well, lets start by explaining what Apple done.

In iOS 17-18.7.2, the Safari WebKit bugs were ALMOST completely gone. However, a very, VERY small leftover of bugs were still inside of the Safari WebKit. With that being said, lets explain how our jailbreak works.
