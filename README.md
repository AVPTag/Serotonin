# Serotonin
Serotonin is a semi-tethered/semi-untethered jailbreak for iOS 17-18.7.2 targetting A4-A18 utilizing the Safari WebKit Leftover Bugs.

|| NOTE: Serotonin is no longer based off of Dopamine. This jailbreak is also not related to other jailbreaks named Serotonin. All instructions are currently not valid until we release the jailbreak. ||

Serotonin is a semi tethered / semi untethered jailbreak for iOS and iPadOS (soon to cover more) 17-18.7.2. The jailbreak will target all devices running A4-A11, A12-A18, and M1-M2.

How does it work?

Well, lets start by explaining what Apple done.

In iOS 17-18.7.2, the Safari WebKit bugs were ALMOST completely gone. However, a very, VERY small leftover of bugs were still inside of the Safari WebKit. With that being said, lets explain how our jailbreak works.

## Requirements:

### For semi-tethered: 
• A MacOS device with Python3, AltServer (AltStore), and "semi-tethered.zip" from Releases.

• Your iPhone or iPad Device with AltStore and Developer Mode on.

### For semi-untethered:

• Your iPhone or iPad Device with Developer Mode on

• Pythonista from the App Store on iPhone or iPad

• Safari and the Shortcuts app

• "semi-untethered.zip" from Releases

# Instructions

## Semi Tethered:

### Instructions:

1. Make sure you have python3, AltServer and "semi-tethered.zip" from OUR GitHub Releases. Any other place claiming to be AVPTag's Serotonin is NOT us. (Other jailbreaks named Serotonin exist, and usually are safe.)

2. Install AltStore onto your iPhone or iPad.

3. From the "semi-tethered.zip" file, extract it somewhere on your mac and get the .ipa file. Sideload it via AltStore. (You need 2 App IDs available.)

4. From the extracted zip file, also go to "host-server.py" and run it via python3. The .py is NOT encrypted, so you can view it yourself to review the contents.

5. When the .py is running, a IP will appear. Take that IP, and open Safari on your iPhone or iPad with that IP AND the port that is given. (Usually 8080 or 7622.)
